# 14. Finer-Grained Parameter Change Tracking

**Priority:** `[priority] low`

**Type:** Performance

The current dirty-flag approach (`_need_categories_update` on
`DatablockItem`) triggers a full update of all categories when any
parameter changes. This is simple and correct. If performance becomes a
concern with many categories, a more granular approach could track which
specific categories are dirty. Only implement when profiling proves it
is needed.

**Depends on:** nothing, but low priority.
