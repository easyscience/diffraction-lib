    "After setting up the experiment, we need to create a sample model that\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, we will create a sample model for silicon (Si) with a\n",

    "the space group, lattice parameters, atomic positions of the atoms in\n",

    "EasyDiffraction refines the crystal structure of the sample, but does\n",
    "not solve it. Therefore, we need a good starting point with reasonable\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we define the Si structure as a cubic structure. As this is a\n",

    "has a single atom in the unit cell, which is located at the origin (0,\n",
    "0, 0) of the unit cell. The symmetry of this site is defined by the\n",
    "Wyckoff letter 'a'. The atomic displacement parameter defines the\n",
    "thermal vibrations of the atoms in the unit cell and is presented as\n",
    "an isotropic parameter (B_iso).\n",

    "Sometimes, the initial crystal structure parameters can be obtained\n",
