# # Fitting Powder Diffraction data
#
# This notebook guides you through the Rietveld refinement of crystal
# structures using simulated powder diffraction data. It consists of two
# parts:
# - Introduction: A simple reference fit using silicon (Si) crystal
#   structure.
# - Exercise: A more complex fit using La₀.₅Ba₀.₅CoO₃ (LBCO) crystal
#   structure.
#
# ## 🛠️ Import Library
#
# We start by importing the necessary library for the analysis. In this
# notebook, we use the EasyDiffraction library. As mentioned in the
# introduction to EasyScience, EasyDiffraction is built on that
# framework and offers a high-level interface focused specifically for
# diffraction analysis.
#
# This notebook is self-contained and designed for hands-on learning.
# However, if you're interested in exploring more advanced features or
# learning about additional capabilities of the EasyDiffraction library,
# please refer to the official documentation:
# https://docs.easydiffraction.org/lib
#
# Depending on your requirements, you may choose to import only specific
# classes. However, for the sake of simplicity in this notebook, we will
# import the entire library.

# ## 📘 Introduction: Simple Reference Fit – Si
#
# Before diving into the more complex fitting exercise with the
# La₀.₅Ba₀.₅CoO₃ (LBCO) crystal structure, let's start with a simpler
# example using the silicon (Si) crystal structure. This will help us
# understand the basic concepts and steps involved in fitting a crystal
# structure using powder diffraction data.
#
# For this part of the notebook, we will use the powder diffraction data
# previously simulated using the Si crystal structure.
#
# ### 📦 Create a Project – 'reference'
#
# In EasyDiffraction, a project serves as a container for all
# information related to the analysis of a specific experiment or set of
# experiments. It enables you to organize your data, experiments, sample
# models, and fitting parameters in a structured manner. You can think
# of it as a folder containing all the essential details about your
# analysis. The project also allows us to visualize both the measured
# and calculated diffraction patterns, among other things.

# %% [markdown] tags=["doc-link"]

# [documentation](https://docs.easydiffraction.org/lib/user-guide/analysis-workflow/project/)
# for more details about creating a project and its purpose in the
# analysis workflow.

# %%
project_1 = ed.Project(name='reference')

# %% [markdown]
# You can set the title and description of the project to provide
# context and information about the analysis being performed. This is
# useful for documentation purposes and helps others (or yourself in the
# future) understand the purpose of the project at a glance.

# ### 🔬 Create an Experiment
#
# An experiment represents a specific diffraction measurement performed
# on a specific sample using a particular instrument. It contains
# details about the measured data, instrument parameters, and other
# relevant information.

# #### Inspect Measured Data
#
# After creating the experiment, we can examine the measured data. The
# measured data consists of a diffraction pattern having time-of-flight
# (TOF) values and corresponding intensities. The TOF values are given
# in microseconds (μs), and the intensities are in arbitrary units.
#
# The data is stored in XYE format, a simple text format containing
# three columns: TOF, intensity, and intensity error (if available).

# for more details about the measured data and its format.
#
# To visualize the measured data, we can use the `plot_meas` method of
# the project. Before plotting, we need to set the plotting engine to
# 'plotly', which provides interactive visualizations.

# %% [markdown]
# If you zoom in on the highest TOF peak (around 120,000 μs), you will
# notice that it has a broad and unusual shape. This distortion, along
# with additional effects on the low TOF peaks, is most likely an
# artifact related to the simplifications made during the simulation
# and/or reduction process and is currently under investigation.
# However, this is outside the scope of this school. Therefore, we will
# simply exclude both the low and high TOF regions from the analysis by
# adding an excluded regions to the experiment.
#
# In real experiments, it is often necessary to exclude certain regions
# from the measured data. For example, the direct beam can significantly
# increase the background at very low angles, making those parts of the
# diffractogram unreliable. Additionally, sample environment components
# may introduce unwanted peaks. In such cases, excluding specific
# regions is often simpler and more effective than modeling them with an
# additional sample phase.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Set Instrument Parameters
#
# After the experiment is created and measured data is loaded, we need
# to set the instrument parameters.
#
# In this type of experiment, the instrument parameters define how the
# measured data is converted between d-spacing and time-of-flight (TOF)
# during the data reduction process as well as the angular position of
# the detector. So, we put values based on those from the reduction.
# These values can be found in the header of the corresponding .XYE
# file. Their names are `two_theta` and `DIFC`, which stand for the
# two-theta angle and the linear conversion factor from d-spacing to
# TOF, respectively.
#
# You can set them manually, but it is more convenient to use the
# `get_value_from_xye_header` function from the EasyDiffraction library.

# %% [markdown]
# Before proceeding, let's take a quick look at the concept of
# parameters in EasyDiffraction, which is similar to the parameter
# concept in EasyScience. The current version of EasyDiffraction is
# transitioning to reuse the parameter system from EasyScience.
#
# That is, every parameter is an object, which has different attributes,
# such as `value`, `units`, etc. To display the parameter of interest,
# you can simply print the parameter object.
#
# For example, to display the linear conversion factor from d-spacing to
# TOF, which is the `calib_d_to_tof_linear` parameter, you can do the
# following:

# %%
print(project_1.experiments['sim_si'].instrument.calib_d_to_tof_linear)

# %% [markdown]
# The `value` attribute represents the current value of the parameter as
# a float. You can access it directly by using the `value` attribute of
# the parameter. This is useful when you want to use the parameter value
# in calculations or when you want to assign it to another parameter.
# For example, to get only the value of the same parameter as floating
# point number, but not the whole object, you can do the following:

# %%
print(project_1.experiments['sim_si'].instrument.calib_d_to_tof_linear.value)

# %% [markdown]
# Note that to set the value of the parameter, you can simply assign a
# new value to the parameter object without using the `value` attribute,
# as we did above.

# %% [markdown] tags=["doc-link"]
# 📖 See
# [documentation](https://docs.easydiffraction.org/lib/user-guide/parameters/)
# for more details about parameters in EasyDiffraction and their
# attributes.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Set Peak Profile Parameters
#
# The next set of parameters is needed to define the peak profile used
# in the fitting process. The peak profile describes the shape of the
# diffraction peaks. They include parameters for the broadening and
# asymmetry of the peaks.
#
# There are several commonly used peak profile functions:
# - **Gaussian**: Describes peaks with a symmetric bell-shaped curve,
#   often used when instrumental broadening dominates. [Click for more
#   details.](https://mantidproject.github.io/docs-versioned/v6.1.0/fitting/fitfunctions/Gaussian.html)
# - **Lorentzian**: Produces narrower central peaks with longer tails,
#   frequently used to model size broadening effects. [Click for more
#   details.](https://mantidproject.github.io/docs-versioned/v6.1.0/fitting/fitfunctions/Lorentzian.html)
# - **Pseudo-Voigt**: A linear combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian
#   components, providing flexibility to represent real diffraction
#   peaks. [Click for more
#   details.](https://mantidproject.github.io/docs-versioned/v6.1.0/fitting/fitfunctions/PseudoVoigt.html)
# - **Pseudo-Voigt convoluted with Ikeda-Carpenter**: Incorporates the
#   asymmetry introduced by the neutron pulse shape in time-of-flight
#   instruments. This is a common choice for TOF neutron powder
#   diffraction data. [Click for more
#   details.](https://docs.mantidproject.org/v6.1.0/fitting/fitfunctions/IkedaCarpenterPV.html)
#
# Here, we use a pseudo-Voigt peak profile function with Ikeda-Carpenter
# asymmetry.
#
# The parameter values are typically determined experimentally on the
# same instrument and under the same configuration as the data being
# analyzed, using measurements of a standard sample. In our case, the Si
# sample serves as this standard reference. We will refine the peak
# profile parameters here, and these refined values will be used as
# starting points for the more complex fit in the next part of the
# notebook. For this initial fit, we will provide reasonable physical
# guesses as starting values.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Set Background
#
# The background of the diffraction pattern represents the portion of
# the pattern that is not related to the crystal structure of the
# sample. It's rather represents noise and other sources of scattering
# that can affect the measured intensities. This includes contributions
# from the instrument, the sample holder, the sample environment, and
# other sources of incoherent scattering.
#
# The background can be modeled in various ways. In this example, we
# will use a simple line segment background, which is a common approach
# for powder diffraction data. The background intensity at any point is
# defined by linear interpolation between neighboring points. The
# background points are selected to span the range of the diffraction
# pattern while avoiding the peaks.
#
# We will add several background points at specific TOF values (in μs)
# and corresponding intensity values. These points are chosen to
# represent the background level in the diffraction pattern free from
# any peaks.
#
# The background points are added using the `add` method of the
# `background` object. The `x` parameter represents the TOF value, and
# the `y` parameter represents the intensity value at that TOF.
#
# Let's set all the background points at a constant value of 0.01, which
# can be roughly estimated by the eye, and we will refine them later
# during the fitting process.

# ### 🧩 Create a Sample Model – Si
#
# After setting up the experiment, we need to create a sample model that
# describes the crystal structure of the sample being analyzed.
#
# In this case, we will create a sample model for silicon (Si) with a
# cubic crystal structure. The sample model contains information about
# the space group, lattice parameters, atomic positions of the atoms in
# the unit cell, atom types, occupancies and atomic displacement
# parameters. The sample model is essential for the fitting process, as
# it is used to calculate the expected diffraction pattern.
#
# EasyDiffraction refines the crystal structure of the sample, but does
# not solve it. Therefore, we need a good starting point with reasonable
# structural parameters.
#
# Here, we define the Si structure as a cubic structure. As this is a
# cubic structure, we only need to define the single lattice parameter,
# which is the length of the unit cell edge. The Si crystal structure
# has a single atom in the unit cell, which is located at the origin (0,
# 0, 0) of the unit cell. The symmetry of this site is defined by the
# Wyckoff letter 'a'. The atomic displacement parameter defines the
# thermal vibrations of the atoms in the unit cell and is presented as
# an isotropic parameter (B_iso).
#
# Sometimes, the initial crystal structure parameters can be obtained
# from one of the crystallographic databases, like for example the
# Crystallography Open Database (COD). In this case, we use the COD
# entry for silicon as a reference for the initial crystal structure
# model: https://www.crystallography.net/cod/4507226.html
#
# Usually, the crystal structure parameters are provided in a CIF file
# format, which is a standard format for crystallographic data. An
# example of a CIF file for silicon is shown below. The CIF file
# contains the space group information, unit cell parameters, and atomic
# positions.

# ### 🚀 Analyze and Fit the Data
#
# After setting up the experiment and sample model, we can now analyze
# the measured diffraction pattern and perform the fit. Building on the
# analogies from the EasyScience library and the previous notebooks, we
# can say that all the parameters we introduced earlier — those defining
# the sample model (crystal structure parameters) and the experiment
# (instrument, background, and peak profile parameters) — together form
# the complete set of parameters that can be refined during the fitting
# process.
#
# Unlike in the previous analysis notebooks, we will not create a
# **math_model** object here. The mathematical model used to calculate
# the expected diffraction pattern is already defined in the library and
# will be applied automatically during the fitting process.

# %% [markdown] **Reminder:**
#
# The fitting process involves comparing the measured diffraction
# pattern with the calculated diffraction pattern based on the sample
# model and instrument parameters. The goal is to adjust the parameters
# of the sample model and the experiment to minimize the difference
# between the measured and calculated diffraction patterns. This is done
# by refining the parameters of the sample model and the instrument
# settings to achieve a better fit.

# #### Set Fit Parameters
#
# To perform the fit, we need to specify the refinement parameters.
# These are the parameters that will be adjusted during the fitting
# process to minimize the difference between the measured and calculated
# diffraction patterns. This is done by setting the `free` attribute of
# the corresponding parameters to `True`.
#
# Note: setting `param.free = True` is equivalent to using `param.fixed
# = False` in the EasyScience library.
#
# We will refine the scale factor of the Si phase, the intensities of
# the background points as well as the peak profile parameters. The
# structure parameters of the Si phase will not be refined, as this
# sample is considered a reference sample with known parameters.

# #### Check Fit Results
#
# You can see that the agreement between the measured and calculated
# diffraction patterns is now much improved and that the intensities of
# the calculated peaks align much better with the measured peaks. To
# check the quality of the fit numerically, we can look at the
# goodness-of-fit χ² value and the reliability R-factors. The χ² value
# is a measure of how well the calculated diffraction pattern matches
# the measured pattern, and it is calculated as the sum of the squared
# differences between the measured and calculated intensities, divided
# by the number of data points. Ideally, the χ² value should be close to
# 1, indicating a good fit.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Visualize Fit Results
#
# After the fit is completed, we can plot the comparison between the
# measured and calculated diffraction patterns again to see how well the
# fit improved the agreement between the two. The calculated diffraction
# pattern is now based on the refined parameters.

# %%
project_1.plot_meas_vs_calc(expt_name='sim_si')

# %% [markdown]
# #### TOF vs d-spacing
#
# The diffraction pattern is typically analyzed and plotted in the
# time-of-flight (TOF) axis, which represents the time it takes for
# neutrons to travel from the sample to the detector. However, it is
# sometimes more convenient to visualize the diffraction pattern in the
# d-spacing axis, which represents the distance between planes in the
# crystal lattice.
#
# The conversion from d-spacing to TOF was already introduced in the
# data reduction notebook. As a reminder, the two are related through
# the instrument calibration parameters according to the equation:
#
# $$ \text{TOF} = \text{offset} + \text{linear} \cdot d + \text{quad}
# \cdot d^{2}, $$
#
# where `offset`, `linear`, and `quad` are calibration parameters.
#
# In our case, only the `linear` term is used (the
# `calib_d_to_tof_linear` parameter we set earlier). The `offset` and
# `quad` terms were not part of the data reduction and are therefore set
# to 0 by default.
#
# The `plot_meas_vs_calc` method of the project allows us to plot the
# measured and calculated diffraction patterns in the d-spacing axis by
# setting the `d_spacing` parameter to `True`.

# %%
project_1.plot_meas_vs_calc(expt_name='sim_si', d_spacing=True)

# %% [markdown]
# As you can see, the calculated diffraction pattern now matches the
# measured pattern much more closely. Typically, additional experimental
# parameters are included in the refinement process to further improve
# the fit. In this example, the structural parameters are not refined
# because the Si crystal structure is a well-known standard reference
# used to calibrate both the instrument and the experimental setup. The
# refined experimental parameters obtained here will then be applied

# ## 💪 Exercise: Complex Fit – LBCO
#
# Now that you have a basic understanding of the fitting process, we
# will undertake a more complex fit of the La₀.₅Ba₀.₅CoO₃ (LBCO) crystal
# structure using simulated powder diffraction data from the data
# reduction notebook.
#
# You can use the same approach as in the previous part of the notebook,
# but this time we will refine a more complex crystal structure LBCO
# with multiple atoms in the unit cell.

# Note that the `occupancy` of the La and Ba atoms is 0.5

# cell. This means that an extra attribute `occupancy` needs to be set
# for those atoms later in the sample model.
#
# We model the La/Ba site using the virtual crystal approximation. In
# this approach, the scattering is taken as a weighted average of La and
# Ba. This reproduces the average diffraction pattern well but does not
# capture certain real-world effects.
#
# The edge cases are:
# - **Random distribution**. La and Ba atoms are placed randomly. The
#    Bragg peaks still match the average structure, but the pattern also
#    shows extra background (diffuse scattering) between the peaks, but
#    this is usually neglected in the analysis.
# - **Perfect ordering**. La and Ba arrange themselves in a regular
#    pattern, creating a larger repeating unit. This gives rise to extra
#    peaks ("superlattice reflections") and changes the intensity of
#    some existing peaks.
# - **Virtual crystal approximation (our model)**. We replace the site
#    with a single "virtual atom" that averages La and Ba. This gives
#    the correct average Bragg peaks but leaves out the extra background
#    of the random case and the extra peaks of the ordered case.

# %% [markdown]
# **Hint:**

# %% [markdown]

# 1. ❌ The conversion parameters from TOF to d-spacing were set based
# on the data reduction step. While they are specific to each dataset
# and thus differ from those used for the Si data, the full reduction
# workflow has already been validated with the Si fit. Therefore, they
# are not the cause of the misfit in this case.
# 2. ✅ The lattice parameters of the LBCO phase were set based on the
# CIF data, which is a good starting point, but they are not necessarily
# as accurate as needed for the fit. The lattice parameters may need to
# be refined.
# 3. ❌ The peak profile parameters do not change the position of the

# LBCO has a cubic crystal structure (space group `P m -3 m`), which

#
# The peak profile parameters were not refined, and their starting
# values were set based on the previous fit of the Si standard sample.
# Although these starting values are reasonable and provide a good
# starting point for the fit, they are not necessarily optimal for the
# LBCO phase. This can be seen while inspecting the individual peaks in
# the diffraction pattern. For example, the calculated curve does not
# perfectly describe the peak at about 1.38 Å, as can be seen below:

# %% [markdown]
# **Solution:**

# %% [markdown] tags=["dmsc-school-hint"]
# 1. ❌ In principle, this could be the case, as sometimes the presence
# of extra peaks in the diffraction pattern can indicate lower symmetry
# than the one used in the model, or that the model is not complete.
# However, in this case, the LBCO phase is correctly modeled based on
# the CIF data.
# 2. ✅ The unexplained peaks are due to the presence of an impurity
# phase in the sample, which is not included in the current model.
# 3. ❌ The data reduction process is not likely to introduce such
# specific peaks, as it is tested and verified in the previous part of

# As you can see, the calculated pattern is now the sum of both phases,
# and Si peaks are visible in the calculated pattern. However, their
# intensities are much too high. Therefore, we need to refine the scale
# factor of the Si phase.

# Now we can perform the fit with both phases included.

# Let's plot the measured diffraction pattern and the calculated
# diffraction pattern both for the full range and for a zoomed-in region
# around the previously unexplained peak near 95,000 μs. The calculated
# pattern will be the sum of the two phases.

# All previously unexplained peaks are now accounted for in the pattern,
# and the fit is improved. Some discrepancies in the peak intensities
# remain, but further improvements would require more advanced data
# reduction and analysis, which are beyond the scope of this school.
#
# To review the analysis results, you can generate and print a summary
# report using the `show_report()` method, as demonstrated in the cell
# below. The report includes parameters related to the sample model and
# the experiment, such as the refined unit cell parameter `a` of LBCO.
#
# Information about the crystal or magnetic structure, along with
# experimental details, fitting quality, and other relevant data, is
# often submitted to crystallographic journals as part of a scientific
# publication. It can also be deposited in crystallographic databases
# when relevant.

# #### Final Remarks
#
# In this part of the notebook, you learned how to use EasyDiffraction
# to refine lattice parameters of a more complex crystal structure,
# La₀.₅Ba₀.₅CoO₃ (LBCO).
#
# In real experiments, you might also refine
# additional parameters, such as atomic positions, occupancies, and
# atomic displacement factors, to achieve an even better fit. For our
# purposes, we'll stop here, as the goal was to give you a starting
# point for analyzing more complex crystal structures with
# EasyDiffraction.

# ## 🎁 Bonus
#
# Congratulations — you've now completed the diffraction data analysis
# part of the DMSC Summer School!
#
# If you'd like to keep exploring, the EasyDiffraction library offers
# many additional tutorials and examples on the official documentation
# site: 👉 https://docs.easydiffraction.org/lib/tutorials/
#
# Besides the Python package, EasyDiffraction also comes with a
# graphical user interface (GUI) that lets you perform similar analyses
# without writing code. To be fair, it's not *quite* feature-complete
# compared to the Python library yet — but we're working on it! 🚧
#
# If you prefer a point-and-click interface over coding, the GUI
# provides a user-friendly way to analyze diffraction data. You can
# download it as a standalone application here: 👉
# https://easydiffraction.org
#
# We'd love to hear your feedback on EasyDiffraction — both the library
# and the GUI! 💬
